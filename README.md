Weather App - MERN Project
This is my second project using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It's a Weather App that allows users to check current weather data for any city. The app fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays key information like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
